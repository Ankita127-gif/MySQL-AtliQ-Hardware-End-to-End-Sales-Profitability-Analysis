# 📊 Sales & Finance Analytics using SQL  
### End-to-End P&L & Performance Reporting System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a growing company that wanted to implement data analytics to make data-driven business decisions.

This project was originally developed in Power BI. I rebuilt the entire business logic using **SQL**, transforming raw transactional data into finance-ready reports and reusable reporting architecture.

The objective was to simulate a real-world Sales & Profitability reporting system completely in SQL.

## 🏗 Data Model

The database follows a **Star Schema**.

### Fact Tables
- `fact_sales_monthly`
- `fact_gross_price`
- `fact_pre_invoice_deductions`
- `fact_post_invoice_deductions`

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_product`
- `dim_customer`

## ⚙ What I Built Using SQL

### 🔹 1. Fiscal Year Logic
- Converted calendar dates into Fiscal Year using User Defined Functions.
- Ensured consistent financial reporting logic across queries.

---

### 🔹 2. Product-Level Sales Reporting
Generated monthly product sales report including:
- Sold Quantity
- Gross Sales
- Net Invoice Sales
- Net Sales

Enabled product performance tracking at SKU level.

---

### 🔹 3. Complete P&L Calculation Pipeline

Implemented full sales calculation logic:

Gross Sales  
→ Net Invoice Sales (after pre-invoice discount)  
→ Net Sales (after post-invoice discount)

To make logic reusable and scalable, I created:

- Views (`sales_preinv_discount`, `sales_postinv_discount`, `net_sales`)
- CTE-based structured queries

Avoided creating physical tables to reduce duplication and storage.

### 🔹 4. Dynamic Stored Procedures

Built parameterized stored procedures for:

- Top N Markets by Net Sales  
- Top N Customers by Net Sales  
- Top N Products per Division  
- Market Badge Classification (Gold/Silver)  

Enabled self-service reporting for stakeholders.

### 🔹 5. Advanced SQL Techniques Used

- Complex JOINs  
- CTEs  
- Window Functions (`OVER()`, `PARTITION BY`)  
- `DENSE_RANK()`  
- Stored Procedures  
- User Defined Functions  
- Views  
- Conditional Logic  
- `FIND_IN_SET` for dynamic filtering

# 📈 Key Business Insights Derived

## 🔹 1. Revenue Concentration Risk
A small number of markets and customers contributed a large portion of total Net Sales.

- Indicates dependency on key accounts  
- Helps in strategic risk planning  

---

## 🔹 2. Discount Impact on Profitability
Significant gap observed between:

- Gross Sales  
- Net Invoice Sales  
- Net Sales  

Pre and post-invoice discounts had major impact on final revenue.

- Supports discount policy evaluation  
- Helps finance team analyze margin leakage  

---

## 🔹 3. Top Performing Markets
Using Top-N analysis, identified high revenue markets (Gold category).

- Enables focused marketing & resource allocation  

---

## 🔹 4. Regional Performance Distribution
Customer contribution varied significantly across regions.

- Helps identify underperforming regions  
- Supports regional sales strategy  

---

## 🔹 5. Product Performance Insights
Top-selling products were identified per division using ranking functions.

- Helps in inventory planning  
- Supports demand forecasting  
- Identifies low-performing SKUs  

---

## 🔹 6. Customer Contribution Analysis
Using window functions, calculated percentage contribution of each customer to total revenue.

- Enables prioritization of strategic accounts  
- Supports account management d
